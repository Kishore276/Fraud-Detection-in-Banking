# Fraud Data Explorer - Streamlit App

This project is an interactive Streamlit application for exploring and analyzing fraud-related datasets, including credit card fraud and bank transaction data. The app provides visualizations, summary statistics, and fraud-specific insights in a user-friendly web interface.

## Features
- Select between Credit Card Fraud Data and Bank Transaction Data
- View sample data and summary statistics
- Visualize transaction amount distributions and categorical breakdowns
- For credit card data: see fraud counts, fraud percentage, fraud vs. non-fraud pie chart, and sample fraudulent transactions
- For bank data: see transaction type and channel breakdowns, and top locations
- All visualizations are interactive and update based on dataset selection

## Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Place your datasets** (`fraudTrain.csv` and `bank_transactions_data_2.csv`) in the project folder.
3. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
   ```
4. **Install dependencies:**
